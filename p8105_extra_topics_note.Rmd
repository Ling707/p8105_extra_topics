## 1/2 R shiny
- Pros
  - allows interactivity, more flexible than dashboard
- `shiny`
  - creating web-apps
- components
  - a user interface
  - code that reacts to inputs and produces outputs
- getting inputs
- producing outputs: `render_`
  - `renderPrint`
  - `renderText`
  - `renderTable`
  - `renderPlot`
  - `renderPlotly`
- flexdashboard + shiny
  - Rmd-based __shiny document__
- sharing shiny products
  - providing files
    - providing **raw** files
    - recipient need to knit/run through Rstudio
  - hosting online
    - need a server(not github) to run R in the background
    - `shinyapps.io`

### practice
- start with `flexdashboard`
- A/B testing dashboard
- hosting shiny doc: copy the code
- shiny apps
